One late night, Andre (main character) decides
to go to the store. He finds a mysterious book
with directions to find a car.

Andre packs up and starts walking down a path
shown in the book. On the way he finds a store.
He goes into the store and finds a girl. Her name
is Rosie.

Andre tells Rosie about the car. Rosie then says
that she has a car of her own, and Andre drives
it to the next path.

On the next path they see a person starting to ram
their car. The person turns out to be part of a gang
who owns the car. The said person overheard Rosie and Andre's
conversation at the store.
